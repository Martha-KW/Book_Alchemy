# 📚 Book Alchemy

**Book Alchemy** is a personal book database built with **Flask**, **SQLite**, and **SQLAlchemy**. It was created as part of my web development training, combining technical learning with my passion for books and writing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flask** (Python web framework)  
- **SQLite** (lightweight relational database)  
- **SQLAlchemy** (ORM for database modeling)  
- **HTML/CSS with Jinja2** (for templating and UI)

## ✨ Features

- Add, edit, and delete books and authors through a clean **web interface**  
- Search and sort functionality for better navigation  
- Automatically links books to authors  
- Optional author detail pages showing birth and death dates  
- Runs locally – no programming knowledge required to manage your personal library

## 📌 Purpose

This project was developed as part of my programming education, but it quickly became a personal favorite – a perfect match between code and creativity. I love reading, and I write fiction myself, so building a book management system felt like the most "me" of all the projects.
